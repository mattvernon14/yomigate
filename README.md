# YomiGate

YomiGate is a Python CLI tool for practicing Japanese kanji 
readings by typing the correct hiragana.

It uses a local SQLite database to store vocabulary and track 
attempts. It can also optionally generate example sentences 
using a local LLM (LM Studio). If no LLM is running, the program 
still works normally.

Japanese keyboard input (IME) is required to type hiragana.
